# 🚀 Gaze Tracking Quick Start Guide

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Run Integration Test (2 minutes)

```bash
# From your Edf_viewer directory
python test_integration.py
```

**Expected**: All 6 tests pass ✅

### 2. Try Your Enhanced EDF Viewer (5 minutes)

```bash
# Launch your enhanced application
python src/main.py
```

**Look for**: New "Gaze" menu in the menu bar

### 3. Test Basic Gaze Features (10 minutes)

#### Setup Mock Gaze Tracking

1. `Gaze → Setup Gaze Tracking`
2. Select "Mock Eye Tracker"
3. Click "OK"

#### Try Enhanced Features

1. Load any EDF file
2. `Gaze → Toggle Gaze Mode` (starts tracking)
3. `Gaze → Enhanced Auto-Scroll` (smart scrolling)
4. `Gaze → View Analytics` (see metrics)

## What You Get Immediately

### ✅ Working Right Now

- **Mock Gaze Tracking**: Full simulation without hardware
- **Intelligent Auto-Scroll**: Pauses at interesting EEG patterns  
- **Automatic Annotations**: Creates annotations at fixation points
- **Session Analytics**: Review speed, efficiency metrics
- **Enhanced UI**: Professional gaze-aware interface

### 🔧 Ready for Hardware

- **Eye Tracker Support**: Plug-in architecture for Tobii, EyeLink, etc.
- **Real-time Processing**: 120+ Hz gaze data processing
- **Clinical Workflow**: Gaze-enhanced EEG review protocols

## Test Scenarios to Try

### Basic Integration (Required)

```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive test
python test_integration.py

# 2. Launch application  
python src/main.py

# 3. Load EDF file and enable gaze mode
```

### Real Workflow Test (Recommended)

1. Load your typical EDF file
2. Enable gaze tracking
3. Use enhanced auto-scroll for 2-3 minutes
4. Check analytics for session metrics
5. Verify annotations were created automatically

### Stress Test (Optional)

1. Load largest EDF file available
2. Enable gaze tracking
3. Rapid navigation for 5+ minutes
4. Monitor performance and stability

## Performance Benchmarks

Your system should achieve:

- **Integration Tests**: 6/6 passing
- **EEG Analysis**: 500+ patterns/second  
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB additional
- **Response Time**: <10ms gaze processing latency

## When to Contact Support

### 🟢 All Good - Continue with real use

- All tests pass
- Application launches with Gaze menu
- Mock tracking works smoothly
- No performance issues

### 🟡 Minor Issues - Proceed with caution

- Some tests fail but core functionality works
- Performance slower than expected
- Minor UI glitches

### 🔴 Major Issues - Need troubleshooting

- Application won't launch
- Critical errors in test suite
- Significant performance degradation
- Features completely non-functional

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No module named 'gaze_tracking'"

**Solution**: Run from correct directory (Edf_viewer root)

### Problem: Qt application errors

**Solution**: Restart application, check Python/Qt versions

### Problem: Poor performance

**Solution**: Reduce gaze sampling rate in setup dialog

### Problem: No Gaze menu

**Solution**: Re-run `python quick_setup.py`

## Ready for Production?

### ✅ Yes, if

- All integration tests pass
- Normal EDF workflow unaffected  
- Gaze features work as expected
- Performance meets requirements

### 🔧 Hardware Next, if

- Mock features work well
- Ready for real eye tracker
- Clinical workflow established
- User training completed
